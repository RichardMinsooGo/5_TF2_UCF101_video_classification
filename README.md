Video classification is more than just simple image classification — **with video we can typically make the assumption that subsequent frames in a video are correlated with respect to their semantic contents.**

If we are able to take advantage of the temporal nature of videos, we can improve our actual video classification results.

Neural network architectures such as Long short-term memory (LSTMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are suited for time series data — two topics that we’ll be covering in later tutorials — but in some cases, they may be overkill. They are also resource-hungry and time-consuming when it comes to training over thousands of video files as you can imagine.
